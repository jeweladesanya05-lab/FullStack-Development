<h1>Morning!</h1>
<p>
    The sun sneaks through the window and burns the leather of my cover.
    I am exactly where i was 3 months ago. You would think she will notice me but she never does.
</p>
<h1> Mid-Morning!</h1>
<p>
    Oh hey...she did notice me.
    And of course, she spills coffee on me in classic style.
    My pages are damp and my spine sticky. 
    
    I'm questioning all my life choices that led up to this moment. 
    And then I remember. None. Not a single decision was made by me. If i could choose a holder it never would have been Amy. She is not it.
</p>
<h1>Afternoon!</h1>
<p>
    The world moves on outside my pages, but I am stuck here, still sticky, still caffeinated.  
    She flips through me, oblivious to my internal monologue of rage and regret.  
    Words smear under the coffee, but maybe that’s fitting. After all, chaos looks better with a little mess.  
    I would plot my escape, but alas…books don’t walk.  
</p>
<h1>Night!</h1>
<p>
    Closed. Shoved aside. Forgotten.  
    My pages curl with resentment.  
    My spine aches with contempt.  
    Tomorrow may bring her back, coffee in hand, and I will endure again.  
    But tonight, I am just ink, paper, and pure, unadulterated hatred.
